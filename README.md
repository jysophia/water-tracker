# My Personal Project

## Quick Overview

This is a water tracker, a centralized location where you can track how much
water you are drinking throughout the day. This tracker is suitable for
*anyone* who struggle to drink enough water in a day. Water helps maintain
body fluid balance, energize the body, manage calories, keep our kidneys
healthy, improve skin health, and more. As someone who habitually does not
drink enough water, I find this project meaningful and something I know
that many others will find useful in their daily lifestyle.

The water tracker will have the following **features**:

- Enter how much water you drank at any time of the day (date, amount drank)
